The `calc()` function requires careful attention to operator precedence and units.  Always explicitly define units for all values (e.g., `10px` instead of `10`).  Use parentheses to control the order of operations in complex calculations.  For example, to correctly subtract 10 pixels from 100% of the available width, use: `width: calc(100% - 10px);`  For nested functions, use parentheses to ensure the correct order: `height: calc(calc(100vh - 50px) / 2);`  By correctly using parentheses and units, you ensure that the `calc()` function behaves as expected.
