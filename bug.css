The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely not work as intended, because the browser might interpret '10' as a unitless number and produce an incorrect calculation. Another issue is with nested `calc()` functions, where proper parentheses are necessary to enforce the correct order of operations.
